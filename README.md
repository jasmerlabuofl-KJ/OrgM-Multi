# OrgM-Multi: A Fiji macro for automated counting and measurement of organoid area, diameter and roundness from bright field images

This program is a derivation of the original OrgM that quantifies the number of organoids in a brightfield image, rather than characterizing a single organoid, and takes several meaurements of all identified organoids. As with the original OrgM, the program can read in one folder containing image files (tif,jpg, png) or a folder containing subdirectories of image files. One additional change is this program creates an output folder showing the identified regions of interest (i.e., organoids) and saves that overlay as a seperate image to assess how well the script identified your specific organoids. 

To use the program follow the step by step user guide. 

The program is written in jython.

OrgM was created by Eddie Cai and Rhalena A. Thomas. This derivation (OrgM-Multi) was created by Kimberly Jasmer.
